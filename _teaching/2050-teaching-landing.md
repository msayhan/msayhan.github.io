Teaching is the profession of interacting with individuals or groups in order to facilitate their intellectual pursuits. Therefore, a teacher must be motivated to contribute to the lives of others in the first place. As learning may occur in various settings via individual tasks, group activities, or reflections on experiences, teaching also requires decent observation and orchestration skills, by which the teacher stimulates the learning environment and improves the process for all participants. In order to live up to these promises all together, a teacher must be a self-learner as well as a performer who consumes knowledge with the objective of multiplying and transmitting it. Given the dizzying pace of science and technology in today's world, acquisition, digestion and transmission of new knowledge is more crucial than ever to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education.
