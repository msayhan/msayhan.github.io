Beyond assisting clinicians in diagnosis, one hope for AI in medical imaging is to identify novel biomarkers that are not easily found by humans. With the learnings from my work in clinically-minded AI, I will focus on diseases of the nervous and cardiovascular systems. I aspire to discover biomarkers and validate them through clinical trials that are also improved via the interaction of experts and models, or even agentic systems for greater sense of human-AI collaboration.
