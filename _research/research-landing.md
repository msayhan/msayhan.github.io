Progress in artificial intelligence (AI) continues to accelerate at a dizzying pace. While instances of AI are expected to stimulate digital innovation and have transformative impacts in our lives through diverse applications, an extensive adoption of AI also calls for scrutiny in order to ensure the safety of these systems and the distribution of their benefits to all, especially in high-stakes fields like medicine. Thanks to my educational background and proven research experience in diverse teams of clinicians, neuroscientists as well as other data and computer scientists, I am well-equipped to address modern challenges regarding not only the development of AI-based solutions with tangible impact but also their thorough inspection prior to deployment in safety critical settings. 

AI promises to transform healthcare by not only improving clinical workflows and patient outcomes but also equitably distributing the benefits to all. To live up to these promises, AI implementations must be informed by the needs of clinicians, patients, healthcare providers as well as legal policies, and thoroughly validated with a clinical mindset. Only then, the state-of-the-art AI models can be conceived as peers (or co-pilots) that train differently and make algorithmic decisions based on sophisticated analyses of data. 

Building upon the vision of algorithmic peers in medicine, I develop principled machine learning approaches that exploit diverse data committed to healthcare repositories while prioritizing the safety and well-being of their users and society. I work closely with medical experts in order to understand their needs and challenges, distill them into precise learning problems, solve them by efficient and interpretable methods and ultimately validate the solutions in downstream scenarios.
